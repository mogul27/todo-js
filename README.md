## Javascript todo list application

### Study notes

NextJS is a framework that sits on top of React whereas react 
is a Javascript library for building user interfaces

NodeJS is part of NextJS and allows asynchronous fetching of things like files

To run "npm run dev" you must be in the folder that contains package.json  

Client side navigation = navigation done by Javascript which is faster than default browser navigation  

External pages outside of the application still require <a> instead of <Link>  

Public folder is used for static assets like images  

NextJS pre-geenrates HTML for pages and then JAvaScript runs to make the page interactive, this is called hydration  

### Javascript code / Syntax learning

export = values can then be imported to other programs using import  

default export means it can be imported without curly braces (Export a single thing for a module)  

Static generation for pages that don't update frequently, server-side if they do update regularly  

The <label> HTML element represents a caption for an item in a user interface. - use for things like checkboxes


### To add

Moglabs section to website  
Date function on the first page once a bit more confident with strcuture  
TODO list backend I think will be a database that we write into and pull from using API Routes and dynamic routes
