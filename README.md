## Javascript todo list application

### Study notes

NextJS is a framework that sits on top of React whereas react 
is a Javascript library for building user interfaces

NodeJS is part of NextJS and allows asynchronous fetching of things like files

To run "npm run dev" you must be in the folder that contains package.json  

Client side navigation = navigation done by Javascript which is faster than default browser navigation  

External pages outside of the application still require <a> instead of <Link>  

Public folder is used for static assets like images  

### Javascript code / Syntax learning

export = values can then be imported to other programs using import  

default export means it can be imported without curly braces (Export a single thing for a module)
